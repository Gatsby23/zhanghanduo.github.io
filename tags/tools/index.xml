      <description>I recently found an hot github repository called code-server which is able to run VS Code on a remote server, accessible through the browser. So it suddenly came to me an idea to remotely edit any code for free as long as you have a linux environment with Internet. Here I will introduce you how to remotely edit and run without the need of Teamviewer, Anydesk, or VcXsrv, etc.</description>

      <title>CLion for catkin projects</title>

      <description>Why use CLion?  Better indexing and intelligence hints for C++ than Eclipse and QtCreator-desktop. Free for students. Also integrate PyCharm already. Good Git integration (although I am still used to commandline git). I really like the code inspection clang-tidy function which makes the code style more modern.  Initial set-up Highly recommend you to add source &amp;lt;CATKIN_WORKSPACE_DIR&amp;gt;/devel/setup.bash to the end of ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc (Depends you use bash or zsh).</description>
